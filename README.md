# LinearRegression
This repository contains my own implementation of a linear regression model used to predict house prices in the Boston Housing dataset. The custom model is compared to scikit-learn's LinearRegression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared (R²) as evaluation metrics.
Features
Custom Linear Regression Implementation:
A self-coded linear regression model built from scratch using gradient descent.

Model Comparison:
Performance comparison between my implementation and scikit-learn's implementation.

Evaluation Metrics:
Metrics such as MSE, MAE, and R² are calculated to assess and compare model performance.

Data Visualization (Optional):
Visual plots to compare predicted vs. actual house prices and analyze model behavior.

Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset is used for this project.
