# LinearRegression
This repository contains my own implementation of a linear regression model used to predict house prices in the Boston Housing dataset. The custom model is compared to scikit-learn's LinearRegression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Squared (RÂ²) as evaluation metrics.
